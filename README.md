# Overview

The software is a student gradebook application written in C#. It allows users to manage student information, including adding students, updating their grades, displaying student details, and calculating average grades.

The purpose of developing this software is to learn C# programming language and object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and abstraction. Additionally, it serves as a practical tool for managing student grades and information.

Tools used for development:
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio
- Programming Language: C#
- Libraries: None specific for this application, as it primarily utilizes built-in .NET libraries for console input/output and data manipulation.

Programming language and libraries:
The software is written in C#, a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

Things to fix, improve, and add in the future:
- Improve user interface: Enhance the user experience by implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of relying on the console.
- Add data validation: Implement input validation to ensure that users provide valid data when adding or updating student information.
- Add sorting and filtering: Implement functionality to sort and filter student data based on various criteria, such as name, grade, or age.
